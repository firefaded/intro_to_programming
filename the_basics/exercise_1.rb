# Exercise 1

# Concatenating strings with variables
first_name = "Kari"
last_name = "Schendel"
# prints the concatenated form of first_name + last_name. The " " added in the middle puts a space between the two strings.
puts first_name + " " + last_name

# Concatenating strings without variables
puts "Kari " + "Schendel"
